## Setup
Our project is a front-development single page document that consist of three parts:
1. The markup file (index.html)
2. The column layout (Bootstrap grid)
3. Personalizing style (style.css)
4. (Extra) The server configuration (Firebase hosting)

### Pre-requisites
- Check the end result example.
- Install a proper IDE/Text editor fo Java and Javascript. IntelliJ community edition is recommended for Java development but doesn't work very well with JavaScript. It's therefore recommended to use VS Code or any other JavaScript-friendly IDE when working with frontend code.
- Install Node.js (if good to use Node on the first week?)

### Example result
Visit the website [Eduardo Alvarez Curriculum Vitae](http://tiny.cc/eduardo-cv). Analyze the structure: introduction, work experience, education and contact information. Think about what sections do you need and what additional content can you include to improve it.

### Install VS Code
Visit the website [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the installer using the button with the label "Stable build". Then proceed with the installation.
